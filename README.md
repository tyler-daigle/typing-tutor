# Typing Tutor

![Typing Tutor Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is just a small typing test that displays your typing speed and accuracy. It is a **typing** test so it won't
work on mobile at all.

It is made with Next.js.

You can run the application by typing

```console
$ npm run dev
```

You can also find it [here](https://remarkable-sunflower-6767da.netlify.app/).
